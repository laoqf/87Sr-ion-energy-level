Brief Manual:
  1. After running the code above, a web page would be opened on the browser. Here is a sample of the default main page.
    (\Figure\intro1.png)
  2. There are 7 blocks in the page:
     Block 1: Biref intro about the program and the formula used in it
     Block 2: Selected states to shown on the Block 4 main figure
     Block 3: Two types of magentic field input for calculating the zeeman splitting in Block 4 & 5
     Block 4: Main figure to show the states
     Block 5: Calculation of selected two Zeeman sub levels
     Block 6: Relation of Zeeman splitting in side the selected state with magnetic field
     Block 7: eigenstate expressed in the |F,mF> and |mI,mJ> basis
